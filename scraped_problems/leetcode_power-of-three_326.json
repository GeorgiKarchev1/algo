  "description": "Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return false. An integer n is a power of three, if there exists an integer x such that n == 3x. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: n = 27 Output: true Explanation: 27 = 33 Example 2: Input: n = 0 Output: false Explanation: There is no x where 3x = 0. Example 3: Input: n = -1 Output: false Explanation: There is no x where 3x = (-1). &nbsp; Constraints: -231 <= n <= 231 - 1 &nbsp; Follow up: Could you solve it without loops/recursion?",
