  "description": "Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic. Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t. All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: s = \"egg\", t = \"add\" Output: true Explanation: The strings s and t can be made identical by: Mapping 'e' to 'a'. Mapping 'g' to 'd'. Example 2: Input: s = \"foo\", t = \"bar\" Output: false Explanation: The strings s and t can not be made identical as 'o' needs to be mapped to both 'a' and 'r'. Example 3: Input: s = \"paper\", t = \"title\" Output: true &nbsp; Constraints: 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104 t.length == s.length s and t consist of any valid ascii character.",
