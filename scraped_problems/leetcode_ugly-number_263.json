  "description": "An ugly number is a positive integer which does not have a prime factor other than 2, 3, and 5. Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: n = 6 Output: true Explanation: 6 = 2 &times; 3 Example 2: Input: n = 1 Output: true Explanation: 1 has no prime factors. Example 3: Input: n = 14 Output: false Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7. &nbsp; Constraints: -231 <= n <= 231 - 1",
