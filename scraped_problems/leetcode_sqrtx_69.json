  "description": "Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well. You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator. For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: x = 4 Output: 2 Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2. Example 2: Input: x = 8 Output: 2 Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned. &nbsp; Constraints: 0 <= x <= 231 - 1",
