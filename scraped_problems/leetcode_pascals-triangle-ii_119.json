  "description": "Given an integer rowIndex, return the rowIndexth (0-indexed) row of the Pascal's triangle. In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown: &nbsp; Example 1: Input: rowIndex = 3 Output: [1,3,3,1] Example 2: Input: rowIndex = 0 Output: [1] Example 3: Input: rowIndex = 1 Output: [1,1] &nbsp; Constraints: 0 <= rowIndex <= 33 &nbsp; Follow up: Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(rowIndex) extra space?",
  "examples": [
    "Input: rowIndex = 3 Output: [1,3,3,1]",
    "Input: rowIndex = 0 Output: [1]",
    "Input: rowIndex = 1 Output: [1,1] &nbsp;"
