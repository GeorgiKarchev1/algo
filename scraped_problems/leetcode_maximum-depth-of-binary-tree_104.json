  "description": "Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth. A binary tree's maximum depth&nbsp;is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7] Output: 3 Example 2: Input: root = [1,null,2] Output: 2 &nbsp; Constraints: The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104]. -100 <= Node.val <= 100",
