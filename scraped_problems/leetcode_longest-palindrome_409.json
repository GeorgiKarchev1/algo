  "description": "Given a string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the longest palindrome&nbsp;that can be built with those letters. Letters are case sensitive, for example, \"Aa\" is not considered a palindrome. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: s = \"abccccdd\" Output: 7 Explanation: One longest palindrome that can be built is \"dccaccd\", whose length is 7. Example 2: Input: s = \"a\" Output: 1 Explanation: The longest palindrome that can be built is \"a\", whose length is 1. &nbsp; Constraints: 1 <= s.length <= 2000 s consists of lowercase and/or uppercase English&nbsp;letters only.",
