  "description": "Given a positive integer n, write a function that returns the number of set bits in its binary representation (also known as the Hamming weight). &nbsp; Example 1: Input: n = 11 Output: 3 Explanation: The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits. Example 2: Input: n = 128 Output: 1 Explanation: The input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit. Example 3: Input: n = 2147483645 Output: 30 Explanation: The input binary string 1111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty set bits. &nbsp; Constraints: 1 <= n <= 231 - 1 &nbsp; Follow up: If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?",
