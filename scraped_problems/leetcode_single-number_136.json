You must&nbsp;implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use&nbsp;only constant&nbsp;extra space. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: nums = [2,2,1] Output: 1 Example 2: Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2] Output: 4 Example 3: Input: nums = [1] Output: 1 &nbsp; Constraints: 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104 -3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104 Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.",
