  "description": "A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers. Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: s = \"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama\" Output: true Explanation: \"amanaplanacanalpanama\" is a palindrome. Example 2: Input: s = \"race a car\" Output: false Explanation: \"raceacar\" is not a palindrome. Example 3: Input: s = \" \" Output: true Explanation: s is an empty string \"\" after removing non-alphanumeric characters. Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome. &nbsp; Constraints: 1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105 s consists only of printable ASCII characters.",
