  "description": "Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not. Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3] Output: true Example 2: Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2] Output: false Example 3: Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2] Output: false &nbsp; Constraints: The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100]. -104 <= Node.val <= 104",
