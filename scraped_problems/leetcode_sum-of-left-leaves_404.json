  "description": "Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of all left leaves. A leaf is a node with no children. A left leaf is a leaf that is the left child of another node. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7] Output: 24 Explanation: There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15 respectively. Example 2: Input: root = [1] Output: 0 &nbsp; Constraints: The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000]. -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000",
