  "description": "Table: Weather +---------------+---------+ | Column Name | Type | +---------------+---------+ | id | int | | recordDate | date | | temperature | int | +---------------+---------+ id is the column with unique values for this table. There are no different rows with the same recordDate. This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day. &nbsp; Write a solution to find all dates' id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday). Return the result table in any order. The result format is in the following example. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: Weather table: +----+------------+-------------+ | id | recordDate | temperature | +----+------------+-------------+ | 1 | 2015-01-01 | 10 | | 2 | 2015-01-02 | 25 | | 3 | 2015-01-03 | 20 | | 4 | 2015-01-04 | 30 | +----+------------+-------------+ Output: +----+ | id | +----+ | 2 | | 4 | +----+ Explanation: In 2015-01-02, the temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25). In 2015-01-04, the temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).",
