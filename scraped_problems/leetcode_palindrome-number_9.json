  "description": "Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: x = 121 Output: true Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left. Example 2: Input: x = -121 Output: false Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome. Example 3: Input: x = 10 Output: false Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome. &nbsp; Constraints: -231&nbsp;<= x <= 231&nbsp;- 1 &nbsp; Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?",
