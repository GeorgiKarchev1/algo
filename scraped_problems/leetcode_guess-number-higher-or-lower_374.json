  "description": "We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows: I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked. Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess. You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results: -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick). 1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick). 0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick). Return the number that I picked. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: n = 10, pick = 6 Output: 6 Example 2: Input: n = 1, pick = 1 Output: 1 Example 3: Input: n = 2, pick = 1 Output: 1 &nbsp; Constraints: 1 <= n <= 231 - 1 1 <= pick <= n",
